For a report on a false positive, please make sure that you include:
- which OS and VM you are using
- which technique(s) have given a false positive
- a screenshot or copy pasted message of the CLI's output

> [!NOTE]
> Specific versions or in-depth system info is not required, just the bare basics is what we're looking for.

If your issue is not a false positive, please make sure to write as much information as needed.
