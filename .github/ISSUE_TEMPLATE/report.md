For a report on a false positive/bug, please make sure that you include:
- which OS and VM you are using
- which technique(s) have given a false positive
- a screenshot or copy pasted message of the CLI's output
- if necessary, running the [debug binary](https://github.com/kernelwernel/VMAware/releases/download/v2.2.0/vmaware_debug.exe) and copy pasting the output would be immensely useful for us to diagnose your issue.

> [!NOTE]
> Specific versions or in-depth system info is not required, just the bare basics is what we're looking for.

If your issue is not a false positive, please make sure to write the necessary information needed.
