| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cli.cpp`  | Entire CLI tool code |
| `vmaware.hpp` | Official and original library header in GPL-3.0, most likely what you're looking for. |
| `vmaware_MIT.hpp` | Same as above but in MIT. But this removes 9 techniques out of 120 |


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The main branch is much more updated with features that haven't been added yet to the latest release. However, they are experimental. 
> If you want something far more stable, it's highly recommended to use the ones in the release section instead.
